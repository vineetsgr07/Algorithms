/**
 * BST Sequences: A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right
 * and inserting each element. Given a binary search tree with distinct elements, print all possible
 * arrays that could have led to this tree.
 * 
 * Example 
 * Input:  
 *           2
 *         1    3
 * 
 * output: {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}
